    <p>Hi this is my site. This is kinda just a place to store stuff about myself. Use the navi bar at the top to go to different stuff.</br><img class="home" src="images/kirby.jpg"></br> I am currently a 17 year old student and I would like to learn coding n games n stuff. I currently know an okay amount of html and i would like to learn lua as well as c++ which will happen eventually. I enjoy lots of stuff to do with games. Stuff like speedrunning, modding and just playing games. All fun and cool. I very much like portal, fortnite and kirby. Very amazing games all of them yup yup. Read the rest of the pages for more cool stuff.</br><img style="width: 40px; height: 40px;"src="images/kirby-hammer.gif"> </br> I also do love th idea of voice acting as i can do a ton of silly voices but i haven't yet done anything to do with that. yet. probably never will do :p</p>
