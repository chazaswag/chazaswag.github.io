			Eimi is a 2024 album released by Australian artist vai5000. Everything to do with the creation of this album was done by Vai. The sound is very similar to Vai's side project, system bios which was an experimental sample heavy album inspired by the 3ds and worked on by Vai and her friends. The artwork itself is a gorgeous angel like figure standing alone on an outstretched hand, looking similar to a ‘buddha’s hand’ statue.  
The album is very digitally inspired. In the music there are walls of bleeding noise, with the sound of skipping on tracks and freezing with the feeling of a rotten disc in some areas. Sometimes the noise is overwhelming and takes over the whole track, in a similar way to some of the tracks on Jane Remover’s ‘Frailty.’  <br><br>

Through many of the tracks the main theme of the album is drawn, that being death. Death is present through the lyrics, inspiration and artwork. Final Fantasy 7 is a big inspiration for the album, more specifically Aerith. As someone who has never played the game but has heard the many spoilers, I know Aerith is a character that dies in the game. It is uncommon for video game characters to die in canon, sure you can have a death in a fight, but Aerith’s death is permanent. Hence the song aerith itself. Some of the artwork is also inspired by FFVII with three singles using different aspects in their artwork. <br><br>

In the lyrics themes of isolation, guilt and denial are brought up. Some tracks lean into isolation more, while some are wrapped in guilt, and some seem to try and pretend the death isn’t real. A massive overarching question presented in the album is “Do you feel?”  The question is present in every song in some way, sometimes deviating to the past tense “Did you feel.” These are often continued in a different way between verses, with “Do you feel your hurt” and “Do you feel my hands.” The repetition of the question in my perspective shows the hopelessness that the singer feels. They cannot ask this person how they feel, if they let them down or even if they hurt them. <br><br>
Eimi as an album is an incredible album to listen to, with cold and sharp feeling electronic noise made to make the listener feel. It is an incredible solo project which is an incredible evolution of Vai’s sound. It has its own feeling and I feel it is hard to compare it to much else it is so incredibly unique and creative. She takes such an inspiring pride with her work, with beautiful lyric books being made and a very cool custom PS Vita as merch. The system home to many of the inspirations for the project with a beautiful skin. Though I was unable to pick one up Vai’s creativity is something I see unmatched by any other artist. I really recommend her to anyone who wants to pick something new up.  <br><br>
My favourite tracks on the album are probably the run of reliant to aerith. I believe this to be some of the most unique sound on the album.
